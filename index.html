    <h1>HTTP/1.1 vs. HTTP/2: Unraveling the Differences</h1>
   
    <h2>Binary vs. Textual:</h2>
    <li>HTTP/1.1 communicates using plain text. Requests and responses are human-readable, 
        but this can lead to inefficiencies due to parsing overhead.</li>
    <li>HTTP/2, on the other hand, uses binary framing. It’s like switching from handwritten letters to a more efficient secret code. 
        The binary format reduces parsing complexity and speeds up communication.</li>

        <h2>Multiplexing:</h2>

        <li>HTTP/1.1: Imagine a highway where each car follows the one in front. Requests are processed sequentially, leading to potential bottlenecks.</li>
        <li>HTTP/2: Picture a multi-lane expressway. It allows multiplexing, meaning multiple requests and responses can travel concurrently over a single connection. No more waiting in line!</li>

        <h2>Parallelism:</h2>
        <li>HTTP/1.1 opens a new TCP connection for each resource (like images, stylesheets, scripts). This can be slow due to connection setup time.</li>
        <li>HTTP/2 is smarter. It reuses a single connection for all resources, reducing latency. Think of it as carpooling for web assets.</li>

        <h2>Header Compression:</h2>
        <li>HTTP/1.1 sends headers (metadata) with each request and response. These headers can get bloated, especially when dealing with cookies and user agents.</li>
        <li>HTTP/2 compresses headers, minimizing overhead. It’s like packing your suitcase more efficiently for a trip.</li>

        <h2>Server Push:</h2>
        <li>HTTP/1.1 waits for the client to request resources. Imagine a waiter who only brings your food after you order.</li>
        <li>HTTP/2 is proactive. It allows server push, where the server anticipates what resources the client will need and sends them ahead of time. It’s like a thoughtful waiter who brings you water without waiting for you to ask.</li>
